**Dark Matter. Minimalist Truths. Sovereign Distribution.**

This is not a bookstore. It is a survival vault. 

Eighty titles. Five decades of running. A lifetime of observing the "Burger Nation" from the outside. 

I don't sell "fixes." I archive reality.

If you found this via a third-party reseller (Gumroad/Amazon), be aware: they are ghosts. This is the only official, sovereign home for my work.
